# Button

A button allows us to highlight actions in the product and make them easily
perceived and achievable through just one click.

## When to use it

Use buttons when users need to either navigate through a product or perform a specific task.

## Usage guidelines

- **Do** always label a button in a clear and understandable way
- **Do** always think about the priority of the action to be taken when choosing a type of button
- **Do** position buttons in a predictable and coherent way throughout the product.
- **Do** combine different button types if you have more than one button in a specific screen
- **Do** use a loading state to provide feedback for our user when the action revolves around saving or
  inputting information, especially when it could take some seconds.

## Content guidelines

- **Do** always start the label with an actionable verb accompanied by a noun to provide enough context (example: "Confirm order").
  The only exceptions are the following common actions: "Save"; "Cancel"; and "Close".
- **Do** keep the label to a maximum of 3 words
- **Do not** capitalize all words of the label, just the first word or brand/product words (such as Apple Pay, for example)

## Component variations

### Primary button

Used to highlight the most important action in a certain page. In most cases, there should be only one primary button visible
at a time.

Used to highlight secondary actions to be takes, specially when there's already a primary action on the page.

### Secondary button

Only use secondary buttons when paired to a primary button, placed in the left side of it. They are used to
signal opposite actions from the primary button, such as "Cancel order".

Used only in the marketing website when you need to position an action over a dark background. It has a
primary and secondary version.

### Plain button

Used when you want to highlight an action within a body text. It should always open in the same window unless
it links to an external source (such as a link to a complete study about card acceptance within a blog post).

### Button sizes

The button component also supports three different sizes: Mega, the best suitable for most cases; Kilo, used
when there is sizing constraints in the button position; and Giga, used for extreme cases when there's little
or no constraint on the button's placement.
